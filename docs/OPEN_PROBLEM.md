# Open problem: the two-clean high-precision endpoint

[Publication scope](../manuscript/PUBLICATION_SCOPE.md) · [Two-clean compiler](OPERATOR_SOURCE_COMPILER.md)

The publication establishes its compiler theorems without resolving this
endpoint. Let $`N=2^n`$, and let $`T^\star_{F,\mathbb R}`$ be the worst-case
minimum T-count for the prescribed real Hopf frame under the complete-input
error contract. At

```math
a=2,\qquad b=N+n+7,\qquad L=N,
```

the retained results give

```math
\Omega(N)\le T^\star_{F,\mathbb R}\le O(N\log N).
```

Here $`a`$ and $`b`$ count initialized clean and arbitrary dirty qubits, and
$`L=\max\{6,\lceil\log_2(1/\eta)\rceil\}`$ for
$`0\lt \eta\le1/64`$. Literal phases, clean-work leakage, and dirty/reference
return error are included in the same operator norm as the
[fault-tolerant theorem](FAULT_TOLERANT_COMPILER.md#1-target-resources-and-theorem).

The [operator-source compiler](OPERATOR_SOURCE_COMPILER.md) has
$`T=O(N+nL)`$ with $`b\ge L+n+7`$. It pays the precision cost at each
tree depth. Neither its dirty-bank refinement nor its literal-diagonal
corollary removes that repeated cost for a general real frame.

With a sufficiently large $`a=\Theta(n)`$ clean reservation and
$`b=\Theta(N)`$, the shared-source compiler instead attains
$`T^\star=\Theta(N)`$ at $`L=N`$. This sufficient clean reservation is
not proved necessary.

The open question is whether two clean qubits permit a jointly charged
$`O(N)`$ construction at the explicit allocation above, or whether a stronger
general lower bound holds. The current upper bound does not establish the
same cost for fewer clean qubits or every prefactor in $`b=\Theta(N)`$.
Restrictions proved for particular source-processing interfaces do not
settle the unrestricted frame problem.

## What the current research resolves

The geometric operator source itself admits a sharp exact synthesis statement:
on $`m\ge2`$ dirty qubits, its minimum exact T-count is $`2m-4`$;
its controlled version requires exactly $`2m-2`$. The
[source construction and Pauli-transfer argument](OPERATOR_SOURCE_COMPILER.md#1-the-operator-source-and-its-exact-native-circuit)
allow arbitrary returned clean and dirty helpers. Thus better exact synthesis of
that same controlled source cannot make an individual call sublinear in the
precision. This is a primitive bound. Costs of separate calls cannot be added
to infer a lower bound for an unrestricted frame compiler.

Moving amplitude amplification to the end also needs a new construction.
Writing $`P=JJ^\dagger`$ and $`B_i=J^\dagger Q_iJ`$, reuse of the same flags gives

```math
J^\dagger Q_2Q_1J
=B_2B_1+J^\dagger Q_2(I-P)Q_1J.
```

The second term is a coherent return from the rejected space. It need not be
small even when the individual accepted blocks are exact. For example,
$`Q_1=Q_2=H\otimes H`$ on the two flags has $`B_1=B_2=1/2`$, but the
product's accepted block is one, not $`1/4`$. The existing layers therefore
cannot be concatenated as unamplified blocks and treated as a product of their
accepted actions. Extra initialized history would also change the two-clean
budget. This observation rules out that inference, not every global design.

## A sufficient construction to seek

At the stated endpoint, it would suffice to construct one actual unitary $`Q`$
using two initialized flags and at most $`N+n+7`$ dirty qubits such that

```math
\left\|2J_2^\dagger QJ_2-(W\otimes I_b)\right\|\le\eta/4,
\qquad T(Q)=O(N),\qquad G(Q)=O(N^2).
```

The source, all table queries, and every helper must be included in these
budgets. The accepted action must hold on every logical and dirty input,
including reference correlations; no return condition is assumed on rejected
branches. The normalization-two amplification lemma then gives the desired
complete-isometry compiler with three charged calls, using the same two flags.
No such jointly charged block is currently established. A proof of this
sufficient interface, or a different full-frame construction, would close the
upper-bound side of the endpoint without requiring intermediate source return.
